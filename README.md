A sphincter says what?

This is a project about 3 people trying to learn 
how to use a DataBase and the different languages
that go with that. Falicia is going to ask a lot
of question so be nice and help. Austin seems
to know what hes doing but I think that is just
a front, but he is still smart. Justin is writing 
this so hopfully he is smart but I know he is just 
fronting fairly hard and wants to learn all of this.
